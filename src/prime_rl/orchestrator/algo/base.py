"""The per-env algorithm runtime: the :class:`Algorithm` base class.

Each named class in this package *is* one training algorithm, one module per
algorithm: it owns the algorithm's two scoring hooks directly —
``score_rollout`` (per arrival) and ``score_group`` (per group) — and declares
which loss component its action tokens feed (``action_loss_type``). Reading a
module top to bottom reads the algorithm; writing your own is subclassing
:class:`Algorithm` and overriding the hooks its signal needs. Shared math (group
normalization, prefill alignment) lives as plain functions in ``advantage.py``;
duplication of orchestration between similar algorithms (e.g. OPD and OPSD) is
accepted so each module stays self-contained.

The two hooks are one scope-and-timing ladder — the wider scope is unlocked by
a later barrier, so the two axes coincide. Both are ``async`` (either may do
I/O); a hook that only does advantage math never awaits:

- ``score_rollout(rollout)`` — one rollout, on arrival: rollout-local signals
  (raw reward, process rewards, echo's observation weighting) *and* per-rollout
  I/O against another model — an inference pool the algorithm connected in
  ``setup()`` (a frozen teacher) or the live policy (opsd's self-distillation),
  queried with bounded concurrency. No siblings.
- ``score_group(group)`` — the cohort, on group completion, *before* filtering
  (filters read the streams): group-relative credit (GRPO/MaxRL baselines).

How rollouts are *produced* is not the algorithm's concern: that is the env's
:class:`~prime_rl.orchestrator.sampler.Sampler`, and sample construction
(interleaving, with observation-token provenance via structural node
attribution) is pure pipeline.

The pipeline (train sink) drives each algorithm through its non-virtual
:meth:`Algorithm.finalize_rollout` / :meth:`Algorithm.finalize_group` methods
and reads the class declarations; it never branches on algorithm config fields
or model roles — liveness of a reference is the only runtime distinction.
prime-rl hosts exactly one model — the trainable policy, whose pool every
algorithm is handed (``self.policy_pool``): use it for anything that scores
against the live model (opsd's self-distillation teacher, an LLM judge, ...).
Every *frozen* model an algorithm needs is an external endpoint it *connects to*
(never launches) and owns, in :meth:`Algorithm.setup`.

    algorithm config's per-token training signal (its sibling :class:`Sampler`
    interprets the ``sampling`` half).

    Everything on this class is yours to override; the pipeline drives the
    compilation through the non-virtual :meth:`finalize_rollout` /
    :meth:`finalize_group` methods and never calls anything else. The surface is:

    - declarations — which loss component the action tokens feed
      (``action_loss_type``);
    - lifecycle — :meth:`setup` connects client pools to the frozen models
      the algorithm declares, resolving each reference via :meth:`connect`;
    - the two scoring hooks, each ``async`` and given the :class:`Rollout`
      directly — read the trace, write credit via
      :meth:`Rollout.assign_advantages`. They are
      async so either stage may do I/O — e.g. a process-reward model or a
      teacher at arrival, or a judge at group time whose signal a pre-batch
      filter then reads; a hook that only does advantage math simply never
      awaits.

      - :meth:`score_rollout` — one rollout, on arrival: rollout-local credit,
        observation ce weights, or per-token results from a model the algorithm
        connected in :meth:`setup` (e.g. teacher reference logprobs). Default:
        nothing.
      - :meth:`score_group` — the cohort, *before* filtering (filters read the
        streams): group-relative credit. Default: nothing — rollouts keep
        ``advantages=None``, so advantage-based filters skip them.

    Model I/O lives in :meth:`score_rollout`: it runs at arrival, *before* the
    pre-batch filters, so it pays compute on rollouts that may then be filtered
    out — accepted for the simpler one-rollout-at-a-time shape.

    Constructed with the algorithm config it interprets plus the live policy
    pool (``self.policy_pool`` — always available, never closed by the
    algorithm). An algorithm that needs to tokenize (e.g. opsd's demonstration
    hint) builds its own renderer in :meth:`setup` from its config; the policy's
    renderer is not threaded in."""
